# Sprint 2 B

In this courselet, you will learn about FastFuels. Two introductory notebooks are provided: `fastfuels-api.ipynb` and `fasfuels-demo.ipynb`. Additionally, a base notebook, `sprint2_3-4_team-name.ipynb`, outlines the specific tasks for your team to complete.

Before running the notebooks, ensure that all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file are installed.

**NOTE:** This courselet is an adaptation of the original Sprint 1 content delivered as part of the [Fire-Ready Forests Data Challenge](https://nationaldataplatform.org/educationhub/datachallenge/learner/1b1cbc30-8477-4cb9-b8a9-c0769999c7d1), which was hosted by the [National Data Platform](https://nationaldataplatform.org/) from February 19 to April 18, 2025.
